# Coding Curves in Swift and AppKit

This is a Xcode 14/Swift 5.7 playground based on the [Coding Curves] series of articles.

I've tried to stay close to the source material, so I haven't used automatically flipped drawing contexts. All drawing is done in `NSImage`s, which you can reveal with quick look from the right margin.
